    <p> Miracle Garden is a real oasis in the desert that has been developed as an answer to the world, which always looks upon Dubai as a city of majestic skyscrapers and glitzy attractions. As you step into this mind-blowing recreational spot, you’ll soon discover that no other name could be as apt as ‘Miracle’ for this botanical tour de force. Before visiting here, read the extraordinary facts about Dubai Miracle Garden that will upgrade your experience.</p>
    <p>Sprawling over an area of about 72,000 square meters of land, Miracle Garden is the world’s largest natural flower garden, decked with an awe-inspiring assortment of flowers – most of which are rare and seen for first time in the Middle East, such as petunias and geraniums. Designed and developed by the Al-Ain based Akar Landscaping and Agriculture Company, this is a natural splendor nestled close to Arabian Ranches, in Dubailand.</p>
    <p>With over 45 million flowers grown and bloomed in a spectrum of colors, styles, and shapes resembling stars, hearts, circles, sculptures, vintage-style vehicles, igloos, and pyramids, the garden is truly a sight for sore eyes amid city’s hustles and bustles. In fact, an endless list of floral varieties, about 120 species, including seasonal specialties has been used to create a garden paradise in the heart of the desert city. It owns the largest numbers of Petunia flowers, which are versatile in embellishments and can bear even the harshest climates of Dubai. Other popular flowers include marigolds, roses, calendulas, and tulips.</p>
    <p>What makes this attraction more intriguing is its unique sub-surface irrigation system that recycles wastewater via drip irrigation while avoiding evaporation and saving up to 75% of water and energy. The maintenance of the garden swallows up 757,000 liters per day. In earlier days the only medium was the sea of Gulf which cost an arm and leg. But the desalination price has been slashed by a huge margin after this smart installation, where the fleet of trucks drives around collecting sewage water. This water purification system makes effective use of the wastewater.</p>
    <p>You would be thinking, what could be so miraculous about this flower garden that makes it world-famous and so different from others? First, this garden is in the arid desert of Dubai, a place which rarely has cultivation is thriving with millions of live flowers. Second, as you step inside the garden, you will be dazzled by the stellar structures shaped up only by flowers, everywhere. From floral themes and sculptures to abounding beddings, the place looks like heaven.</p>
    <p>One of the many of its attractions is a stupendous flower wall of the 1-kilometer circumference that has made the garden into the list of candidates competing for a Guinness Record for the longest flower wall in the world. Also, a marvelous segment of the garden is its 4 kilometers long pathway adorned with a vivid range of floral selections.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-left:650px;">Burj Khalifa</h1>
    <div>
        <img style="margin-left: 280px;" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/183342824/photo/stylized-aerial-view-of-dubai-city.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=outZOT9DOF6lRhp9S6pXY-FHVt1_9yW3e4ToE2-S1N0=">

    <p>Not only is Burj Khalifa the world's tallest building but it has also broken two other impressive records: tallest structure, previously held by the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, and tallest free-standing structure, previously held by Toronto's CN Tower. The Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has established 3 criteria to determine what makes a tall building tall. Burj Khalifa wins by far in all three categories.</p>
    <p>Height to architectural top
        Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the architectural top of the building. This includes spires but does not include antennae, signage, flagpoles or other functional-technical equipment. This measurement is the most widely used and is used to define the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat rankings of the Tallest Buildings in the World.
        
        Highest occupied floor
        Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest continually occupied floor within the building. Maintenance areas are not included.
        
        Height to tip
        Height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest point of the building, irrespective of material or function of the highest element. This includes antennae, flagpoles, signage and other functional-technical equipment.

    <p>Khalīfah, mixed-use skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that is the world’s tallest building, according to all three of the main criteria by which such buildings are judged (see Researcher’s Note: Heights of Buildings). Burj Khalifa (“Khalifa Tower”), known during construction as Burj Dubai, was officially named to honour the leader of the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan. Although the tower was formally opened on January 4, 2010, the entirety of the interior was not complete at that time. Built to house a variety of commercial, residential, and hospitality ventures, the tower—whose intended height remained a closely guarded secret throughout its construction—reached completion at 163 floors and a height of 2,717 feet (828 metres).</p>

    <p>It was designed by the Chicago-based architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Adrian Smith served as architect, and William F. Baker served as structural engineer.</p>
    <p>The building, modular in plan, is laid out on a three-lobed footprint that is an abstract rendering of the local Hymenocallis flower. The Y-shaped plan plays a central role in the reduction of wind forces on the tower. A hexagonal central core is buttressed by a series of wings, each with its own concrete core and perimeter columns. As the tower increases in height, the wings step back in a spiral configuration, changing the building’s shape at each tier and so reducing the effect of the wind on the building. The central core emerges at the tower’s top and is finished with a spire, which reaches more than 700 feet (200 metres). </p>

    <h1 style="padding-left: 650px;">Palm Jumeirah</h1>
    <div>
        <img style="margin-left: 280px;" src="https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/dubai-palm-island-1.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Palm Jumeirah, artificial offshore islands in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the site of private residences and hotels. From the air, the archipelago resembles a stylized palm tree within a circle. Palm Jumeirah was built in the early 21st century and was largely financed from Dubai’s substantial income from petroleum.</p>
    <p>Trunk, spine, fronds, and crescent are the names by which the principal sectors of Palm Jumeirah are known. The broad trunk, connected to the mainland by a bridge, serves as the entrance to the development. Another bridge connects the trunk to the spine, a narrow central axis from which 17 fronds protrude. The crescent is a breakwater that nearly surrounds the other sectors. It is divided into three sections so as to facilitate the circulation of seawater. A vehicular tunnel connects the spine to the crescent, and a transit monorail runs about 3 miles (4.8 km) from the mainland to the crescent through the spine and trunk. The crescent is 650 feet (200 metres) wide and about 10.5 miles (17 km) long altogether. At least 1,380 acres (560 hectares) of new land were created in all, within an area about 3.1 miles (5 km) in diameter.</p>
    <p>The developer of Palm Jumeirah was Nakheel, a real estate company now owned by the government of Dubai. The master plan was drawn up by Helman Hurley Charvat Peacock, an American architectural firm. The islets were made mostly from sand dredged from the floor of the Persian Gulf, but the side of the crescent that is exposed to the open sea was shored up with stones and boulders from the mainland. Work started in 2001, and land and basic infrastructure were in place by 2004. Construction of the buildings began in 2006, and the first residents arrived in 2007.</p>
    <p>Apartments, retail facilities, and a few hotels are situated on the trunk. Closely spaced villas line the long fronds, while most of the hotels and resorts are located on the crescent. In the second decade of the 21st century, at least 10,000 people lived in Palm Jumeirah; some estimates were much higher.

        Palm Jumeirah was intended to be the first of three similarly shaped offshore developments in Dubai. The others, Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira, are both much larger than Palm Jumeirah but remain uncompleted because of economic uncertainty. Also incomplete is the World, a grouping of artificial islands that is intended, upon completion, to resemble a map of the world.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-left: 650px;">Museum of the Future</h1>
    <div>
        <img style="margin-left: 280px;" src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Museum-of-Future-Exterior-3.jpg?w=1200">
    </div>
    <p>The building is an architectural and engineering marvel. It confidently straddles the past and the future, applying advanced technology to traditional artforms. The building ‘speaks Arabic’: its facade is a canvas for the poetry of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum rendered in the calligraphy of Mattar bin Lahej.

        The building’s form is futuristic: it opens a new path away from the highrise towers that dominate skylines everywhere. Its form is symbolic: The circular building represents humanity; the green mound it sits atop represents the earth; the void represents the unknown future.
        
        </p>
    <p>One of Dubai's most famous landmarks, the Museum of the Future (MOTF) takes pride of place along the city's superhighway, Sheikh Zayed Road. Founded by the Dubai Future Foundation and launched on 22 February 2022, the museum explores how society could evolve in the coming decades using science and technology.

        Termed a 'living museum', it incorporates elements of traditional exhibitions, immersive theatre and themed attractions, so visitors can look beyond the present and towards the future's limitless possibilities. Furthering a global intellectual movement, it's also the headquarters for the city's ‘Great Arab Minds’ initiative that aims to identify 1,000 exceptional Arab talents across key fields.</p>

    <p>Designed as an asymmetric torus clad in steel and glass, the Museum of the Future has been recognised by National Geographic as one of 14 most beautiful museums in the world. It's a credit to architect Shaun Killa, who wanted the structure to represent Dubai’s vision of the future. 

The museum's striking exterior also stands out thanks to its artistic use of Arabic calligraphy, which functions as glass windows too. Designed by Emirati artist Mattar bin Lahej, they reflect lines of inspirational poetry by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. Of the three quotes enveloping the facade, one translates to: “The future belongs to those who can imagine it, design it and execute it. It isn't something you await, but rather create.” </p>

    <p>A gateway to the world 50 years from now, the landmark development will contribute to a better humanity and stronger global economy by demonstrating how next-generation solutions – incorporating everything from artificial intelligence to augmented reality – can enhance our lives.

        Visitors will have the chance to engage with this game-changing technology. Each floor of the museum is designed like an expansive, interactive movie set, brought to life by expert storytellers, technologists and visionary artists. Topics in focus include the future of space travel and living, climate change and ecology, health, wellness and spirituality. Aside from ground-breaking innovations, there will also be special workshops and talks from the world's greatest minds. 
        
        Children aged three to 10 can enjoy an open-world experience at the Future Heroes environment, a dedicated area designed to encourage little ones to tap into their potential. Guests also ought to make a stop at the viewing deck on level two – nestled within the museum's 'void', it provides an up-close experience of the facade's smooth inner shell, alongside panoramic vistas of Dubai's fast-paced urban centre.</p>
