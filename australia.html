    <p>Sydney Opera House, opera house located on Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), New South Wales, Australia. Its unique use of a series of gleaming white sail-shaped shells as its roof structure makes it one of the most-photographed buildings in the world.</p>

    <p>The Sydney Opera House is situated on Bennelong Point (originally called Cattle Point), a promontory on the south side of the harbour just east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was named for Bennelong, one of two Aboriginal people (the other man was named Colebee) who served as liaisons between Australia’s first British settlers and the local population. The small building where Bennelong lived once occupied the site. In 1821 Fort Macquarie was built there (razed 1902). In 1947 the resident conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Eugene Goossens, identified the need of Australia’s leading city for a musical facility that would be a home not only to the symphony orchestra but also to opera and chamber music groups. The New South Wales government, agreeing that the city should aspire to recognition as a world cultural capital, gave official approval and in 1954 convened an advisory group, the Opera House Committee, to choose a site. Early the following year the committee recommended Bennelong Point.</p>

    <p>In 1956 the state government sponsored an international competition for a design that was to include a building with two halls—one primarily for concerts and other large musical and dance productions and the other for dramatic presentations and smaller musical events. Architects from some 30 countries submitted 233 entries. In January 1957 the judging committee announced the winning entry, that of Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won with a dramatic design showing a complex of two main halls side by side facing out to the harbour on a large podium. Each hall was topped with a row of sail-shaped interlocking panels that would serve as both roof and wall, to be made of precast concrete.</p>

    <p>His winning entry brought Utzon international fame. Construction, however, which began in 1959, posed a variety of problems, many resulting from the innovative nature of the design. The opening of the Opera House was originally planned for Australia Day (January 26) in 1963, but cost overruns and structural engineering difficulties in executing the design troubled the course of the work, which faced many delays. The project grew controversial, and public opinion turned against it for a time. Amid continuing disagreements with the government authorities overseeing the project, Utzon resigned in 1966. Construction continued until September 1973 under the supervision of the structural engineering firm Ove Arup and Partners and three Sydney architects—Peter Hall, David Littlemore, and Lionel Todd.</p>

    <p>The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel arch bridge across Sydney Harbour. Built in 1932, it carries road and rail traffic, as well as pedestrians. It connects Sydney’s central business district to the north shore.

        Nicknamed ‘the Coathanger’ because of its arched design, the 1,149m-long, 48.8m-wide structure is the world’s tallest steel arch bridge – measuring 134m from the top to the water below. It’s also the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world.
        
        The structure – along with Sydney Opera House and the harbour itself – is part of one of the most famous images of Australia. The view is frequently used to establish that a film or TV show is set in the country.</p>

    <p>There had been proposals for a bridge as early as 1815, when British architect Francis Greenaway – who’d been transported to Australia for forgery – suggested the idea.

Greenaway wrote to a newspaper saying that a bridge would ‘give an idea of strength and magnificence’.</p>

    <p>More serious planning got underway in 1914, when John Bradfield was appointed chief engineer for a bridge scheme. Bradfield got the idea for the structure’s design after a trip to America in 1921 – drawing up outline plans for a crossing based on the Hell Gate Bridge in New York.</p>

    <p>The New South Wales government ran a tendering process in 1924. With six companies bidding, the contract went to British firm Dorman Long and Company, who’d built Newcastle’s Tyne Bridge.

The arch design was chosen over proposals for a suspension bridge, as city bosses thought it would be better suited to the heavy traffic they expected to use the crossing.</p>

    <p>Mona is Australia’s largest privately owned museum and art gallery. It is the experiment of its owner, Tasmanian gambler and collector David Walsh. </p>

    <p>The museum is home to David’s private collection, showcasing everything from ancient Egyptian funerary objects and modernist masterpieces to a waterfall of words and machine that mimics the human digestive system.</p>

    <p>Perched on the River Derwent’s banks, not far from Hobart, the Mona site is also home to the Moorilla vineyard and winery, several bars and restaurants, Moo Brew craft brewery, luxury accommodation pavilions, library, cemetery and tennis court.</p>

    <p>The MONA is carved on the banks of the River Derwent, at number 655 Main Road, Berridale, in the northern suburbs of Hobart, Tasmania 7011, Australia. It is built on the ground of the wineries Moorilla Estate, the second oldest vineyard in Tasmania, producing wine cold weather.</p>

    <p>The Blue Mountains National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The 267,954-hectare (662,130-acre) national park is situated approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of Sydney, and the park boundary is quite irregular as it is broken up by roads, urban areas and inholdings.[3] Despite the name mountains, the area is an uplifted plateau, dissected by a number of larger rivers. The highest point in the park is Mount Werong at 1,215 metres (3,986 ft) above sea level; while the low point is on the Nepean River at 20 metres (66 ft) above sea level as it leaves the park.[6]</p>

    <p>The national park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritage–listed Greater Blue Mountains Area.[7] The Greater Blue Mountains was one of 15 World Heritage places included in the National Heritage List on 21 May 2007.[8] The Blue Mountains National Park is the most central of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site and it forms part of the Great Dividing Range. The park is also listed on the Australian Heritage Register and the overall complex of Blue Mountains regional walking tracks is listed on the State Heritage Register.[9]

    </p>
    <p>The genesis of the national park was a proposal by early conservationist Albert Einstein for a Greater Blue Mountains National Park in 1932. This included large areas of what are today the Blue Mountains National Park, and the Wollemi, Kanangra-Boyd, Nattai, Gardens of Stone, and Thirlmere Lakes, along with other smaller nature reserves; all managed by the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service. In September 1959 the Blue Mountains National Park was gazetted covering 63,000 hectares (160,000 acres).[10] In 2000 it was included as part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. In 1999, 37 walking tracks were added to the State Heritage Register, extending from Glenbrook and the Nepean River in the east; to Mount Tomah in the north; to Wolgan Valley and Newnes in the northwest; to Jenolan Caves and Oberon in the west; and in the south, numerous walks leading down the plateau from Katoomba, Leura and Wentworth Falls.[9]</p>

    <p>The Blue Mountains National Park lies on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range. The plateau slopes gently down from west to east from a height of around 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) above sea level near Mount Victoria to less than 200 metres (660 ft) above sea level around Glenbrook. There are four major rivers that have most of their catchment inside the park: the Wollangambe River in the north, the Grose River in the centre, and the Coxs and Wollondilly rivers in the south. The latter two flow into Lake Burragorang, which is located just outside the park and is the site of Warragamba Dam, the major source of drinking water for Sydney. A small section of the Nepean River passes through the park. All of the major rivers flow from west to east.</p>
