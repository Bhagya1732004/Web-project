    <p>One of  the best tourist places in Thailand, stroll around the Thai capital for 417 years and you will get the feel of an open – air museum. Every corner of Ayutthaya speaks of structures dating back to centuries, ruins of the second capital of Siam and marvels of art and architecture. This is one of the best places to see in Thailand to learn about the country’s glorious past.</p>
    <p>This place is ideal for those who really have some interest in the history of a particular country as each and every monument situated at this place tells us about the past of Thailand. This place comes under the world heritage site and has been protected by the UNESCO. Most of the things that were built here no longer sustain and what we see here is the remains of it.</p>

    <p>Whatever is left and is seen by people was recollected by the UNESCO. Most of the idols that we see here are of Buddha, but they are not in good condition at all. Some do not have their head and others do not have some other parts of the idol. One can come here by any of the local transport services and can spend the whole day watching these amazing and beautiful art forms.</p>

INTRODUCTION ON TEMPLES & RUINS
There are many missing bricks in relation to the ruins of Ayutthaya. For one, there is no clear chronological record of their construction. It is nearly
impossible to determine the exact sequence of their development. Such information would be priceless in understanding how the city unfolded over
centuries. Beth Fouser classifies the city's temple into three architectural sub-periods. The first began when King U-Thong (Ramathibodi I) founded
the city in 1351. This sub-period is characterized by the predominance of Khmer-influenced sanctuary towers known as prangs. After King U-Thong
established a settlement in Ayutthaya, he marched military troops to Angkor to find a resource for inexpensive labor. Thousands of war slaves,
women, and skilled artisans were removed from Angkor to build his new city. Naturally, they brought knowledge about this architectural style with
them.</p>
    <h1 style="padding-left: px;">Mu Ko Chang National Park</h1>

    <h1 style="padding-left: px;">Khao Yai National Park </h1>
    <div>
        <img style="margin-left: 280px;" src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_602014862-1.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>Khao Yai is no doubt the best national park in Thailand for regular visitors where it is relatively easy to see some impressive animals.

        Established in 1962 as Thailand's first national park, it is the third largest national park in Thailand. Situated mainly in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Khao Yai extends into Prachinburi, Saraburi and Nakhon Nayok provinces. The main checkpoint of the park is 180 km from Bangkok.
        
        The park covers an area of 2,168 km², including rain/evergreen forests and grasslands. 1,351 meters tall Khao Rom is the highest mountain within the park. The average altitude of the national park ranges from 400 to 1,000 meters asl.</p>
    <p>Khao Yai is part of the Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex; a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO, covering 5 protected areas from Khao Yai to Cambodian border. The other protected areas are; Pang Sida National Park, Thap Lan National Park, Ta Phraya National Park and Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary.

        The rainy season is from May to October with high humidity and with the most rainfall in September. The rest of the year is quite dry. November to February are the winter months with cooler weather and average temperatures of 22 °C during the day and down to 9-10 °C during the night.</p>
    <p>Surely there are few other parks in the country with more impressive wildlife, but of the easily accessible national parks in Thailand, Khao Yai is no doubt the best option for mammal watching. Apart from Kui Buri National Park, Khao Yai is the next best park in the country where it is relatively easy to run into elephants with a bit of luck.</p>
    <p>Some other often seen mammals include northern pig-tailed macaques, barking deer, sambar deer, gibbons, porcupines, civets. Other more elusive species seen from time to time are sun bears, Asian black bears, gaurs, otters, dholes and jackals.

        The northern pig-tailed macaques sighting is a bit rare elsewhere in the country, they may easily be overlooked. Most tourists easily mix them up with the long-tailed macaques which are very common at many tourist destinations.</p>
    <h1 style="padding-left: 649px;">Koh Chang</h1>
    <div>
        <img style="margin-left: 280px;" src="https://pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/706164/-1/829299d0b0f80a05018f9598e5c1f06a.jpg?ca=10&ce=1&s=1024x768">

    <p>Ko Chang island, known also as ‘Elephant Island’ named because of its elephant shaped headland, is Thailand’s third largest island after Phuket and Samui. It is located around 300 kilometres east of Bangkok in Trat Province, in the Gulf of Thailand near the Cambodian border.</p>
    <p>From jungle covered mountain peaks to sweeping bays, great waterfalls to flourishing coral reefs, beach huts to luxury resorts, Koh Chang has plenty to offer for everyone.Ko Chang is part of the Mu Ko Chang National Park. Despite its increase in development and tourism in the past decade or so, it has retained its remote and rugged character.

        With an area covering approximately 212 square kilometres, 70% of Koh Chang is covered in rainforests, mountains and beaches. The highest peak on the island is Khao Salak Phet, rising from the ground at 743 meters, and given its mountainous terrain there is an abundance of waterfalls with the tallest but not always the most accessible being Klong Neung waterfall, which can be found in thesouth-eastern corner of the island.</p>
    <p>Ko Chang has three main seasons, the cool season runs from November to the end of February. This is when the island is at it’s busiest, with guaranteed daily sunshine, stunning blue skies and calm seas. If you don’t mind crowds, this is the ideal time to visit. During this time the average temperature is between 27C and 30C, you may experience the odd refreshing thunderstorm.</p>
    <p>Ko Chang used to be well off the beaten path and only visited by the hardened backpacker, and although the island has seen a big increase in development and tourism in the last 10 or so years due to the Thai government trying to develop it, it is still not on the same level as the southern islands such as Phuket or Koh Samui. With an airport located just 20 kilometres away from the ferry terminal in Trat, Ko Chang is easier to get to than ever before.  There are three daily flights from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport on Bangkok Airways.</p>

    <p>Chiang Mai, also spelled Chiengmai, largest city in northern Thailand and the third largest city in the nation after metropolitan Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima. It is located on the Ping River, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya River, near the centre of a fertile intermontane basin at an elevation of 1,100 feet (335 m). It serves as the religious, economic, cultural, educational, and transportation centre for both northern Thailand and part of neighbouring Myanmar (Burma). Once the capital of an independent kingdom, the city also has strong cultural ties with Laos.</p>
    <p>The settlement, founded as a royal residence in 1292 and as a town in 1296, served as the capital of the Lanna Thai kingdom until 1558, when it fell to the Myanmar. In 1774 the Siamese king Taksin drove out the Myanmar; but Chiang Mai retained a degree of independence from Bangkok until the late 19th century.

        In contrast to the normally densely populated Asian city, Chiang Mai has the appearance of a large village—orderly, clean, traditional, and almost sprawling. The older part of town, particularly the 18th-century walled settlement, is on the west bank of the river; it contains ruins of many 13th- and 14th-century temples. The modern east-bank portion is a more open area. Two bridges cross the broad Ping River. Chiang Mai is a flourishing tourist and resort centre. Phu Ping Palace, the summer home of the Thai royal family, is nearby.</p>
    <p>The city is renowned as a centre of Thai handicrafts. Small villages nearby specialize in crafts such as silverwork, wood carving, and making pottery, umbrellas, and lacquerware. Traditional Thai silk is woven at San Kamphaeng to the east.

        Educational facilities include the Northern Technical Institute (1957), the Maejo Institute of Agricultural Technology (1934), and Chiang Mai University (1964). Affiliated with the university are the Tribal Research Centre, the Lanna Thai Social Sciences Research Centre, the Regional Centre of Mineral Resources, the Industrial Economics Centre of Northern Thailand, the Anaemia and Malnutrition Research Centre, and the Multiple Cropping Project.</p>
